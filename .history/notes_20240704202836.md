# Toes
The use of this is to make a smiley face when the car speeds up, and a frown space when the cae slows down.

Lastly if a stop, or fast deceleration is taking place it will flash the stop sign.

Sofar I have hand coded many of the states for the steps,
how ever I have not make all of the betweens, nor the acceleration part yet.

#  Todo:
- [ ] make the   \acceleration part
- [ ] make smooth transitions
- [ ] make a accelerometer simulation code
